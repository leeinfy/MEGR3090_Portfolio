    <center><h1>Blynk Assignment</h1>
      <br>
      Material Used: Raspberry Pi, LED, Camera module, DC motor, L298N motor drive,Blynk.<br>

      The wiring is almost the same as My python setup. The raspberrypi is connect with a motordrive. It is also connected with LED.
      The Blynk project is use the Blynk phone app to connect the motor and LED. The LED is connect to pin4 and a 330ohm resistor.
      the motor drive motor1 pin 1 , pin2 and speed pin are connect to GPIO 17, 27, and 22. The camera module is also mounted on the
      raspberry pi.<br><br>

      This program cycle the mode everytime the button is pressed. the first mode is servo in its 90 degree postion, and
      the dc motor is stopped. The second mode is servo is 0 degree position, and dc motor drive forward. the third mode is servo
      is 180 degree position, and the dc motor in backward mode. I was original want to use the joystick to control the speed of motor.
      Since the joystick need extra circuit for analog input. I only wrote the 50 PWM dutycycle. And in the buttonispressed function is 
      for button debouncing issue.<br><br>
      Lesson learned: python code syntax, raspberry gpio digital and analog output, control and monitor the raspberry gpio via terminal.
      <br><br>
      There are also some issues unsovled. The first one is the analog input reading from the peripheral. The second issue is AngularServo.
      I use angularservo library first, but the servo is jittering. it suggest me to use
      <a href="https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api_pins.html#module-gpiozero.pins.pigpio"> PiGpio </a>. However, the syntax only
      works on LED. The last one is i followed the guide of <a  href="https://bc-robotics.com/tutorials/getting-started-blynk-raspberry-pi-3/">BCrobotic </a> 
      website blynk connection guide. But the button and LED dont work. i end up at step 13<br>

      I was be able to connected to Blynk. But i have no idea how to make blynk work. I attach a LED with pin2 and setup the LED wedge in blynk to virtual 2. I pasted the code
      in <a href="https://github.com/blynkkk/lib-python">bylink-python </a> sample code to write the virtual 2 registor. But when i run the code nothing happen. My LED
      on the Blynk didn't read the value.<br>
