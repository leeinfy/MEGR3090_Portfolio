        The raspberry pi was remote on windows with VNC connect through internet. And with my username Yinfei Li

        <video src="Video/LowFidelityPrototype.mp4">
        The LED was connected with GPIO4, and Buzzer was connected with GPIO2. I don't have botton therefore, i replaced
        it with a jumpwire. When the jumpwire is plugged in the circuit is closed the on screen button is off. when the ciruit
        is open the button shows on status.
