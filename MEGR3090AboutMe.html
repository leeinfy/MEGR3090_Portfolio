      <p>Hello, my name is Yinfei Li. I was a computer science major when I first entered college. In the summer of my
        freshman year, i took entrance level enginnering coarse in CP community college to fullfill my science general education.
        In that coarse, we used laser cutter and wood, to make a draw bridge model. I was the one who design the gear and mechanical system.
        Since then i found my interest in mechancial enginnering. I really like analysis force and motion of objects, however, i don't like
        the course relative to material science.

        My strengths are creative and having a great time management. My flaws
        are having a bad memory and public speaking. The five things on my
        bucket list are attending a music academy , buying my own car, building
        up a new PC, working for military and traveling to Europe. In my opinion,
        the most influencing designs in past 150 years are power plant, engine,
        and integrated circuit. <br>
        <br>
        I would like to design a guitar tuner for myself. The dimension of the
        tuner is about 2*2*2 inches. I want it to be as light as possible. And I
        also want to control the budget within $10.<br>
        <br>
        I spent 30 minutes on this assignment. However, I might add color and
        elements in the future. </p>
