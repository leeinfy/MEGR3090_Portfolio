      <p>Hello, my name is Yinfei Li. I was a computer science major when I first entered college. In the summer of my
        freshman year, i took entrance level enginnering coarse in CP community college to fullfill my science general education.
        In that coarse, we used laser cutter and wood, to make a draw bridge model. I was the one who design the gear and mechanical system.
        Since then i found my interest in mechancial enginnering. I really like analysis force and motion of objects, however, i don't like
        the course relative to material science.

        My strengths are creativity and having a deeply intensive mental state of attention. My flaws
        are having a bad time management and public speaking skill. The five things on my
        bucket list are attending a music academy , buying my own car, building
        up a new PC, working for military and traveling to Europe. In my opinion,
        the most influencing designs in past 150 years are power plant, jet engine,
        and integrated circuit. <br>

        The first German scientist comes to my mind is Albert Enistein. He is widely
        acknowledge by this mass-energy equation E=mc<sup>2</sup>. His biggest scientific contribution
        is theory of relativity. This theory was published in early 1900s, and it is now one of the
        foundations of morden physics. His theory was used almost in every aerospace project.
        The closest to our life is GPS.
