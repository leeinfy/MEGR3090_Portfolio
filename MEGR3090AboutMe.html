      <p>Hello, my name is Yinfei Li. I was born in Dalian, China. And I moved
        to U.S. 4 years ago. I choose to study mechanical engineering, because
        my favorite Documentary is <i>mega projects</i>. I hope to join one of
        those projects in the future. I am thrilled to transfer precarious ideas
        into feasible and usable products.<br>
        <br>
        My strengths are creative and having a great time management. My flaws
        are having a bad memory and public speaking. The five things on my
        bucket list are attending a music academy , buying my own car, building
        up a new PC, working in military and traveling to Europe. In my opinion,
        the most influencing designs in past 150 years are power plant, engine,
        and integrated circuit. <br>
        <br>
        I would like to design a guitar tuner for myself. The dimension of the
        tuner is about 2*2*2 inches. I want it to be as light as possible. And I
        also want to control the budget within $10.<br>
        <br>
        I spent 30 minutes on this assignment. However, I might add color and
        elements in the future. </p>
