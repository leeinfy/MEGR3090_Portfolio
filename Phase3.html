    <center><h1>Personal Revor Robots</h1>
      <p> I would like to design a personal robot which i could use in my home.<br>
        -be able to turn and move in complex condition. my room is messy and small. therefore, i need a robot which could move in any direction or have a small turn angle<br>
        -have a 360 degree camera to monitor the surrounding condition, thus i could control on internet.<br>
        -have microphone & speaker, so i could speak through the robot.<br>
        -carry some load eg: snaks<br>
        -be able to conquer small level. My parents house's kitchen have a level difference around 2 to 3 inches.<br>
