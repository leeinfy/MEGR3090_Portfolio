    <center><h1>Personal Map Rover Robots</h1>
      <p> I would like to design a personal robot which i could use in my home.<br>
        -Goal: is to design a Robots could map the unkonw surrounding obstacle.<br>
        -material need: ultrosonic sensor, acclerometer, camera, servo, and robot builded in phase 2.<br>
        -the map is record as a angle and distance coordinate as a file. And might build a real time remote graphy. (depend on time) <br>
       </p>
      <br><br>

      First, i redesign the configeration of my robot. And move my raspberry pi to base1. And now I will be able to charge my battery wtihout
      tear the robot apart.<br><br>

      I import the Distance Sesnor and run the code. It returns the distance in meter.<br><br>

      The new configuration is printed and now i could charge my rover or change the baterry without disassemble them.<br><br>

      The servo only be able to move a 180 degree angle. In order to move the Ultrasonic Sensor for 360. I need to desgin at least 2 over 1 gear ratio gearbox.
      This is my CAD model of my gearbox. the gear ratio is 20 oever 8.<br><br>
      After printing the gearbox out. i find out the servo and gear connection part was not good, it cause a lot of variance during the rotation. Thus i improve the gearbox
      and the assembly to improve the performance of the ultrosonic parts of my robot. (the fianl assembly CAD below)

      Then I assembly the rest of my parts together.

      The code makes the ultrasonic sensor determined the distance of surround with 15 degree angle each step and a total of 24 times. Then these data was stored in a txt file.
      To map from another position. I will determine the angle and time the robot moved. The angle was determined by gyroscrope. However, the microcontroller vaires. I have to 
      manully changed the resgistor address corresponded to my MPU.
      <a href="https://github.com/leeinfy/Yinfei-Li-website/blob/main/accelerTest.py">gyroscrope code</a><br>
      The gyroscrope code was working periodicly. Thus this function has not yet been applied to my main script.<br><br>
