    <center><h1>Personal Map Rover Robots</h1>
      <p> I would like to design a personal robot which i could use in my home.<br>
        -Goal: is to design a Robots could map the unkonw surrounding obstacle.<br>
        -material need: ultrosonic sensor, acclerometer, camera, servo, and robot builded in phase 2.<br>
        -the map is record as a angle and distance coordinate as a file. And might build a real time remote graphy. (depend on time) <br>
       </p>
      <br><br>

      First, i redesign the configeration of my robot. And move my raspberry pi to base1. And now I will be able to charge my battery wtihout
      tear the robot apart.<br><br>

      I import the Distance Sesnor and run the code. It returns the distance in meter.<br><br>

      The new configuration is printed and now i could charge my rover or change the baterry without disassemble them.<br><br>

      The servo only be able to move a 180 degree angle. In order to move the Ultrasonic Sensor for 360. I need to desgin at least 2 over 1 gear ratio gearbox.
      This is my CAD model of my gearbox. the gear ratio is 20 oever 8.<br><br>
