    <center><h1>Python Assignment</h1>
      <br>
      Material Used: Raspberry Pi, Button, Servo, DC motor, L298N motor drive.<br>

      I currently only have one button avaliable, therefore, I decide to manage all the changes only in one button.
      The DC motor drive is main power of the robot. And the camera mount may need servo for a 180 degree rotation.
      I was also planning to add a joystick to the prototype. But these module need to get access to analog read, 
      which needs some external integral circuit to achieve. The servo is connect to 3.3v and ground. the analog pin of servo is connect
      to pin 22. the motor direction pin is connect to pin 17 and 27, motor speed pin is connect to pin 2. the button read input from pin
      4. <br><br>

      This program cycle the mode everytime the button is pressed. the first mode is servo in its 90 degree postion, and
      the dc motor is stopped. The second mode is servo is 0 degree position, and dc motor drive forward. the third mode is servo
      is 180 degree position, and the dc motor in backward mode. I was original want to use the joystick to control the speed of motor.
      Since the joystick need extra circuit for analog input. I only wrote the 50 PWM dutycycle. And in the buttonispressed function is 
      for button debouncing issue.<br><br>
      Lesson learned: python code syntax, raspberry gpio digital and analog output, control and monitor the raspberry gpio via terminal.
      <br><br>
      There are also some issues unsovled. The first one is the analog input reading from the peripheral. The second issue is AngularServo.
      I use angularservo library first, but the servo is jittering. it suggest me to use PiGpio. However, the syntax only
      works on LED. The last one is i followed the guide of <a  href="https://bc-robotics.com/tutorials/getting-started-blynk-raspberry-pi-3/">BCrobotic </a> 
      website blynk connection guide. But the button and LED dont work. i end up at step 13<br>

      I was be able to connected to Blynk. But i have no idea how to make blynk work. I attach a LED with pin2 and setup the LED wedge in blynk to virtual 2. I pasted the code
      in <a href="https://github.com/blynkkk/lib-python">bylink-python </a> sample code to write the virtual 2 registor. But when i run the code nothing happen.<br>
